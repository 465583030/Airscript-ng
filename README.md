# Aircrack-ng script
My first python script. Using inefficient python commands to automate the process of cracking a wifi-network. Very poorly and quickly made. Requires python3+ and aircrack-ng as well as a chipset that supports monitor mode and packet injection. Usage is pretty much "python3 aircrack-ng.py" or "chmod +x" followed by "./aircrack-ng.py" the rest is self explainatory. I know this is quite bad and offers no additonal advantages to existing tool such as wifite,etc, in-fact it is much worse, but it doesn't hurt to try right? I made this mainly for simplicity. It may be handy when someone less used to the aircrack-ng suite tries to use it or when someone is doing a demo.
